Summary: * Force India want P4 in the WCC * Fernley says they just cannot keep up with top teams; Ferrari 1.5sec/lap quicker in longruns * at the moment FI are fighting Toro Rosso, HaasF1, and Renault for P5; Williams still too quick, but FI hope to catch up * car struggling with balance issues and wind tunnel correlation * the car is 10kg over the minimum weight, which is their biggest issue; they actually expected to have room for 10kg of ballast * Mercedes engine heavier to last longer * gearbox heavier than expected; due to the longer wheelbase it's 12cm longer and it had to be reinforced after issues with the rear impact crash test * Ocon and Perez currently both at 72kg; have been asked to get down to 70kg for Melbourne * Force India won't attempt qualifying simulations, because of their weight handicap * exhaust cracks over time, which they are addressing by just replacing the pipe once the bodywork starts getting burnt; a proper fix is planned for Melbourne * cooling is too conservative, which means sidepods too wide at the front and generally too big; they are currently blocking off parts of the radiators * after initial struggles progress is being made with the setup; Perez says medium tyre too hard for them	0
